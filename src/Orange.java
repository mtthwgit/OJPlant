/**
 * Orange is a class used for testing multithreading with Plant and Worker. Each instance of Orange
 * has an enumeration that shows its "state" (i.e. fetched, peeled) and a thread can do
 * "work" on the Orange which delays the thread for an abstract amount of time to
 * simulate the work and then gets the next "state".
